Hi, I'm Khojasteh. I am a researcher at Mount Sinai NYC, [Department of Neuroscience](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/friedman) at the [Schaffer Lab](https://www.schafferlab.com/). 
I build artificial neural networks that are inspired by biological neural networks. 

I am researching how a specific brain region (S1DZ) functions by building deep learning models with supervised and reinforcement learning. These models aim to mimic proprioceptive feedback. I then compare the networkâ€™s activations with real neural activity. I am also interested in the interpretability of networks, and understanding what's happening inside them through reverse engineering. 

My background is a mxiture of data science, ML, computer engineering, dynamcis and control, and some IoT. 
In my free time I enjoy watching Formula 1, flight simming, taking a walk along the Hudson, and sometimes tinkering with CAD/ 3D printing. I also like writing and making research more accessible, which is the purpose of this page. Science and research should be easy to understand for everyone. Avoiding complicated jargon provides a gentle introduction to the field. [Distil](https://distill.pub/) (now discontinued) was a big inspiration for this page. 
If you spot mistakes or have sugestions, feel free to reach out at kzm6[at]cornell[dot]edu. I am pretty active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khojasteh-mirza/) as well.
