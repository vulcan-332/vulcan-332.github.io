Hi, I'm Khojasteh. I am a researcher at Mount Sinai NYC, Department of Neuroscience at the Schaffer Lab. 
I build artificial neural networks that are inspired by biological neural networks. 

I am currently working on understanding more about how S1DZ works by building a network to mimic certain brain functions (proprioceptive feedback) and comparing activations from that network with real neural activity. 

I am also interested in the interpretability of networks, and understanding what's happening inside them through reverse engineering.
