Hi, I'm Khojasteh. I am a researcher at Mount Sinai NYC, Department of Neuroscience at the Schaffer Lab. 
I build artificial neural networks that are inspired by biological neural networks. 

I am currently working on understanding more about how S1DZ works by building a network to mimic certain brain functions (proprioceptive feedback) and comparing activations from that network with real neural activity. 

I am also interested in the interpretability of networks, and understanding what's happening inside them through reverse engineering. 

In my free time, I enjoy writing and making research more accessible, which is the purpose of this page. Science and research should be easy to understand for everyone. Avoiding complicated jargon provides a gentle introduction to the field. If you spot mistakes or have sugestions, feel free to reach out! I am pretty active on LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/in/khojasteh-mirza/].
